# Discourse ‚Üí Discord Webhook

This Python-based webhook receives events from a Discourse forum and selectively forwards them to a Discord channel using a Discord webhook.

## üîß What It Does

This webhook filters, processes, and relays relevant forum activity from Discourse to Discord, with a focus on **privacy and clarity**.

### ‚úÖ Core Features

- **Listens for webhooks** sent from a Discourse forum (e.g. `topic_created`, `post_created`).
- **Filters out messages** from system-level users like:
  - `system`
  - `discobot`
  - `anonymous`
- **Skips private messages** (`topic_archetype: "private_message"`) to avoid leaking sensitive or internal notifications to Discord.
- **Ignores unnecessary event types**, e.g. `topic_closed_status_updated`.
- **Strips HTML tags** from post content for clean formatting in Discord.
- **Sends Discord messages** only for relevant, public posts by real users.
